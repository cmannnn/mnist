Classic classification with MNIST 

MNIST is a set of 70,000 small images of digits handwritten by high school students and employees of the US Census Bureau. There are labels to the digit images it represents. Very often referred as the "Hello World" of ML. OFten used as a benchmark for testing new classification models. Have to love sample data in Colab.
